This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.",1.0,R,False,False,False,True,2,1,False,False,False,False,2.0,F,White,US,Education,True,cross race

This study addressed these gaps by investigating how Latinx immigrants across two generations made sense of their work as callings. By interviewing Latinx immigrants (N = 36) this study revealed that first- and second-generation immigrants co-constructed integrated callings. Unlike individual callings, integrated callings are tied to a common understanding of how various journeys are connected. Within immigrant families, there was an understanding about the relationship between first-generation immigrants’ migration journeys and second-generation immigrants’ occupational journeys. Across the two generations, work was tied to educational, occupational, and non-occupational outcomes that served to improve the lives of immigrants. The proposed framework, integrated callings, is one that accounts for non-occupational outcomes and the experiences of diverse workers.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,Hispanic,US,Education,True,Hispanic only

A parallel survey and field experiment (N = 4,659) establishes the persuasive potential of low-profile interest groups in both controlled and realistic settings.

We find that humor increases the likelihood to share political information with others and enhances people’s memory for information.

However, prior research has largely neglected that upward comparisons on SNS may also facilitate positive outcomes, specifically media-induced inspiration, a motivational state highly conducive to well-being. We conducted two experiments that tested whether and how cognitive-affective processing of visual SNS postings results in inspiration. Study 1 (N = 270) provides first evidence that users react to more positive, optimized Instagram nature and travel posts with stronger upward comparison, which facilitates inspiration via an assimilative emotional reaction (benign envy), thus enhancing well-being. The preregistered Study 2 (N = 408) replicates these findings. Overall, results indicate that users can be inspired from comparing upwards on SNS, which may briefly improve their well-being.

The results indicated that perceptions of support messages as conveying dominance and having weak argument quality were positively associated with psychological reactance. Low person-centered messages corresponded with more dominance and weaker argument quality. Low person-centered messages were associated with more psychological reactance through an indirect effect conveyed by a perceived threat to freedom.

In Study 1, a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment varied (high vs low) the perceptions of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency associated with a protagonist’s harmful acts to examine their effect on liking for a well-known hero.

Findings indicate narrative cues serve as antecedent factors that prompt either internal or external attributions for a protagonist’s harmful behavior. Internal attributions negatively predict character liking, whereas external attributions are positive predictors. Findings suggest that writers, when they want viewers to like characters, may use attribution theory principles to signal that external factors caused the character’s harmful acts.

We link the implications ensuing from the e-waste issue with the roles mediation and communication of environmental narratives play, and how they can be informed by such “medianatures,” as well as geopolitical considerations.",1.0,R,True,True,True,False,1,2,False,True,False,False,2.0,F,White,SE,Education,False,White only

Our analysis suggests that resources available for managing emotions are inextricably linked to interactional role performances, and dirty workers may violate secrecy norms to attain levels of intimacy and social support contingent upon shared knowledge of salient social roles.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,3.0,F,White,US,Education,True,White only

We observe that the digitized collection of feedback is not fed back to disaster-affected communities, but is directed to donors as evidence of “impact.” Rather than improving accountability to affected people, digitized feedback mechanisms sustained humanitarianism's power asymmetries.",1.0,R,True,False,True,True,2,2,True,True,True,True,4.0,F,White,GB,Education,False,cross race

Cette étude explore l’effet des images médiatiques et de la race sur l’attribution d’une responsabilité quant aux conséquences de l’ouragan Katrina. Les participants, Noirs et Blancs, ont lu la même nouvelle concernant l’ouragan et ses suites, l’histoire ayant été manipulée pour inclure des images de victimes blanches, des images de victimes noires ou aucune image du tout. On a ensuite demandé aux participants de dire qui était selon eux responsable du désastre humanitaire ayant suivi la tempête. Les répondants blancs ont exprimé moins d’impressions de responsabilité gouvernementale lorsque l’histoire incluait des photos de victimes. Cet effet n’est pas apparu chez les participants noirs.

Diese Studie betrachtet die Wirkung von Nachrichtenbildern und Rasse auf die Zuschreibung von Verantwortlichkeit für die Konsequenzen von Hurrikan Katrina. Die Teilnehmer schwarzer und weißer Hautfarbe lasen die gleichen Nachrichten über den Hurrikan und dessen Folgen. Die Bilder zeigten entweder weiße Opfer, schwarze Opfer oder es wurde auf eine Bebilderung verzichtet. Die Teilnehmer wurden dann gefragt, wen sie für die humanitäre Katastrophe nach dem Sturm verantwortlich machten. Weiße Teilnehmer zogen die Regierung weniger in die Verantwortung, wenn Bilder von Opfern gezeigt wurden. Für schwarze Teilnehmer zeigte sich dieser Effekt nicht. Die Bilder beeinflussten nicht die Zuschreibung von Verantwortlichkeit auf die Einwohner von New Orleans selbst. Diese Ergebnisse werden im Sinne der Annahmen der Framing-Theorie interpretiert, bei denen Bilder als episodische Framing-Mechanismen dienen.

Les participants plus âgés (faible statut et faible incertitude) étaient plus susceptibles de sélectionner des informations négatives à propos des jeunes que des informations positives à propos de cet exogroupe ou que des informations négatives à propos de personnes plus âgées. De plus, l’exposition à des informations négatives concernant les individus plus jeunes a renforcé l’estime de soi chez les participants plus âgés.

Sich selbst zufriedenstellen: Selektive Wahrnehmung von Nachrichten über In- und Out-Groups und deren Wirkung auf das Selbstbewusstsein

Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick & Matthias R. Hastall

Mittels einer Sekundäranalyse von Experimentaldaten zur selektiven Wahrnehmung von positiven und negativen Nachrichtenartikeln über gleichaltrige und jüngere bzw. ältere Personen testeten wir verschiedene Hypothesen. Eine Stichprobe von 178 jungen (18-30 Jahre) und 98 älteren (50-65 Jahre) Erwachsenen las ein Online-Nachrichtenmagazin während ihre Lesezeiten mittels Software mitgeloggt wurde. Jüngere Personen (hoher Status, hohe Unsicherheit) konzentrierten sich beim Lesen eher auf gleichaltrige Personen. Ältere Personen (niedriger Status, niedrige Unsicherheit) wählten häufiger negative Nachrichten über junge Personen als positive Nachrichten über diese Out-Group oder negative Nachrichten über ältere Personen. Außerdem stärkte die Rezeption negativen Nachrichten über jüngere Personen das Selbstbewusstsein der älteren Teilnehmer.

Findings reveal that use of the technology for information exchange and recreation are positive predictors of participation in civic life, however associations are moderated by mobile communication competence. Notably, individuals who report higher levels of comfort with mobile telephony and use it for information exchange tend to be more civically and politically engaged than those who report less comfort with the technology. These findings shed new light on the positive role of mobile communication in civil society, while highlighting competence as an emergent dimension of the so-called “second-level” digital divide, which has traditionally focused on computer skills.



La communication mobile et la vie civique : associer les usages à l’engagement civique et politique

Scott W. Campbell & Nojin Kwak

Cette étude a utilisé une approche des usages et gratifications pour investiguer les manières dont les usages de téléphones mobiles sont liés à l’implication civique et politique. Les résultats révèlent que l’usage de la technologie pour l’échange d’informations et la récréation sont des variables explicatives positives de la participation dans la vie civique. Les associations sont toutefois modérées par la compétence en communication mobile. Notamment, les individus qui déclarent de plus haut degrés d’aise avec la téléphonie mobile et qui l’utilisent pour l’échange d’informations tendent àêtre plus engagés civiquement et politiquement que ceux qui déclarent être moins à l’aise avec la technologie. Ces résultats jettent un nouvel éclairage sur le rôle positif de la communication mobile dans la société civile, tout en soulignant que la compétence est une dimension émergente du soi-disant fossé numérique « de second ordre », qui s’est traditionnellement concentré sur les compétences à l’ordinateur.

Mobilkommunikation und bürgerliches Leben: Die Verknüpfung von Nutzungsmustern mit bürgerlichen und politischen Engagement

Scott W. Campbell & Nojin Kwak

Die Studie nutzt einen Uses-and-Gratifications-Ansatz, um zu untersuchen, wie Handynutzungsmuster mit bürgerlicher und politischer Teilhabe verknüpft sind. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Nutzung der Technologie für den Informationsaustausch und Erholung positive Prädiktoren für eine Teilhabe am bürgerlichen Leben sind, wobei die Zusammenhänge durch Handykompetenz moderiert werden. Erwähnenswert ist, dass Teilnehmer, die eine größere Behaglichkeit im Umgang mit Mobiltelefonie angaben und diese für den Informationsaustausch einsetzen, häufiger bürgerlich und politisch involviert waren als jene, die sich unwohler mit der Technologie fühlten. Diese Ergebnisse beleuchten die positive Rolle der Mobilkommunikation in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und unterstreichen dabei Kompetenz als die herausragende Dimension der sogenannten digitalen Kluft der zweiten Ebene, welche sonst immer auf Computerfähigkeiten fokussiert hat.

La polarisation et l’exposition sélective partisane

Natalie Jomini Stroud

De nos jours, les gens peuvent aisément sélectionner les médias qui partagent leurs prédispositions politiques, un comportement connu sous le nom de l’exposition sélective partisane. Des études additionnelles sont toutefois nécessaires pour mieux comprendre les causes et les conséquences de l’exposition sélective partisane. Cette étude explore la relation entre l’exposition sélective partisane et la polarisation politique à partir de données du National Annenberg Election Survey. Les résultats en coupe transversale offrent des preuves solides à l’effet que l’exposition sélective partisane est liée à la polarisation. Des analyses au fil du temps documentent le fait que l’exposition sélective partisane mène à la polarisation. Certaines preuves soutiennent la direction causale inverse, à savoir que la polarisation mène à l’exposition sélective partisane. Les implications pour l’étude des effets médiatiques et les conséquences normatives (tant positives que négatives) sont discutées.

Polarisierung und voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung

Natalie Jomini Stroud

Heutzutage können Menschen ohne Probleme Medienangebote auswählen, die ihre politischen Prädispositionen widerspiegeln - ein Verhalten, welches als voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung bezeichnet wird. Wir benötigen allerdings intensivere Forschung, um die Gründe und Konsequenzen dieser voreingenommenen selektiven Wahrnehmung besser zu verstehen. Die Studie untersucht die Beziehung zwischen voreingenommener selektiver Wahrnehmung und politischer Polarisierung mittels Daten der Nationalen Annenberg Wahlbefragung. Querschnittsanalysen geben deutliche Hinweise darauf, dass voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung in Zusammenhang mit Polarisierung steht. Analysen im Zeitverlauf dokumentieren, dass voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung zu Polarisierung führt. Einige Hinweise stützen auch die umgekehrte Kausalrichtung, nämlich dass Polarisierung zu voreingenommener selektiver Wahrnehmung führt. Implikationen für die Untersuchung von Medienwirkungen und normative Implikationen – positiv als auch negativ – werden diskutiert.

We contend that alliance partners communicatively co-construct the alliance with stakeholders in order to mobilize economic, social, cultural, and political capital. By focusing on the communication of alliances' existence and character, new propositions emerge concerning the role of communication, capital mobilization resulting from NGO–corporate alliances, NGOs and corporations' choice(s) of alliance partner(s), the number of partners with whom organizations are likely to communicate, and potential risks and rewards. The model is illustrated using the Rainforest Alliance and Chiquita Better Banana program as an abbreviated case study.

Communication networks have been theorized to be a key factor for accomplishing team coordination. However, empirical research has largely taken a static approach by viewing communication networks as material, structural arrangements, which we call structural communication networks (SCNs). Informed by network structuration theory, we articulate a complementary approach, called processual communication networks (PCNs), which views communication networks as episodic, dynamic, and sequential. To test this, we conducted a multi-team experiment of 62 teams embedded in a virtual world where their primary objective was to coordinate an attack on a group of insurgents. Using relational event modeling to capture the dynamics of PCNs, we hypothesized and found support for the role of PCNs as a mediator of SCNs and an indicator of structural appropriation. Moreover, highly decentralized PCNs positively predicted coordination, regardless of whether they were faithfully or ironically appropriated.",1.0,R,False,False,True,True,2,1,True,False,False,False,7.0,M,White,US,Education,True,cross race

Knowledge as direct experience supports the putative universality of self-interest and the sovereignty of individuals as exclusive public actors. Presuming a uniformity of understanding, communication as information exchange dissociates advocates from messages and contributes to the Friedmans’ view of persuasion as an individualistic mode of interaction. Connecting the Friedmans’ model to contemporary scholarly critiques of neoliberalism, I argue that this model portends significant anti-democratic consequences. Citing former U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ campaign to reorganize public education as a market, I illustrate the contemporary circulation of this model.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,M,White,US,Education,True,White only

Second, we turn the focus from the “counter,” as a public or space distinct from the dominant sphere, towards distributed forms of contention. Finally, instead of considering media as arenas of claims, we investigate how media are constitutive of contentious publicness, which can be studied along its material, spatial, and temporal dimensions. These moves lead to an analytical framework through which trajectories of contentious publicness can be systematically traced and evaluated. Through case studies on the 2011 Egyptian uprising and the Occupy protests, we demonstrate how this framework can be employed to examine the construction of new contentious actors and evaluate their democratic legitimacy as claim-makers.",1.0,R,True,False,True,False,1,2,False,True,False,False,2.0,F,White,GB,Education,False,White only

In recognizing a distinction between direct and virtual witnessing, it establishes a conceptual basis for an inductive typology delineating interrelated, potential citizen-subject positions across a continuum.

In the first instance, the post-structuralist approach insists on seeing current professional journalistic norms as examples of hegemonic discursive formations that achieve ascendancy over other options. Through this perspective, one can interrogate how ethnic media and journalism are excluded from democratic public debates on the basis of contingent communicative values dressed up as objective norms.

By conducting a review of the main theoretical frameworks that have deepened the issue, we observe a gradual progression from the dominance of external views to the emergence of indigenous people’s own perspectives. We propose four analytical theoretical approaches that depict continuities (media and information and communication technology [ICT] appropriation; policies and regulation) and discontinuities (indigenous media; communication from Buen Vivir) regarding traditional Latin American frameworks. We also discuss the limitations of the original literature on this topic, and we provide a set of conclusions and recommendations for further studies.

Este artículo sintetiza los desarrollos teóricos relativos a la comunicación indígena latinoamericana formulados en la última década (2005-2015). A partir de una revisión de los principales marcos teóricos que han contribuido a profundizar esta cuestión, observamos una progresión gradual desde el predominio de visiones externas hacia la emergencia de perspectivas propiamente indígenas, e identificamos cuatro enfoques analítico-teóricos que ilustran continuidades (apropiación de los medios y las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación, y políticas y regulaciones) y discontinuidades (medios indígenas, y comunicación desde el Buen Vivir). La revisión sirve asimismo como base para considerar las limitaciones de los primeros antecedentes en el estudio de la comunicación indígena, y sugerir líneas de investigación futuras.

Language mediation is observed as a self-referential communication system fulfilling the function of promoting participation and new narratives through reflexive coordination. In particular, the concept of structural coupling explains how language mediation can enhance change within other communication systems, promoting dialogue across difference.

Particularly in explaining the failures of transnational communication, explanatory potential often seems to lie just outside the limited vision of each of the 3 perspectives—and outside the scope of empirical analyses that are limited to Western contexts.",1.0,R,True,False,False,False,1,2,False,False,False,False,2.0,M,White,CH,Education,False,White only

Earhart utilized the transcendent persona to illustrate an alternative vocabulary of what contemporary theorists might call feminine gender performativity.

Despite the common structural constraints (rural patriarchy and inadequate social resources), left-behind women’s socio-structural immobilities vary depending on their specific relationship with migrants (conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics), which embodies the asymmetrical nature of transnationalism. The findings highlight the dynamic negotiation between left-behind caregivers’ communicative mobilities and their contextualized socio-structural immobilities, which leads to diverse forms of agency and disempowerment. This article shows that communicative mobility is not only manifested as media use but also embodied as media (non)use.

Lay Summary

Transnational labor migration has allowed people in poor areas to improve their financial well-being, but has also caused separations among many families. Thanks to the prevalence of various digital media (e.g., instant messaging, webcam and voice calls, and social media platforms, etc.), fragmented family members are able to maintain and manage different family relationships despite geographic constraints. This study draws on three groups of female caregivers (mothers, aunts, and grandmothers) in Fuqing, a major transnational migrant-labor-sending area in China. I am particularly interested in how these left-behind women collaborate with migrant parents to fulfil their duties of raising left-behind children through digital media. The findings suggest that left-behind women’s life experiences are not only related to gender norms and inadequate social resources (e.g., a lack of job opportunities and robust social welfare system) in rural China, but also pertinent to their specific relationship with migrants (e.g., conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics). While female caregivers’ different situations influence their media practices during childrearing collaboration with migrant parents, such media engagement also contributes to the shaping of their transnational family relationships.",3.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,M,Asian,CN,Education,False,Asian only

This article reports on the development and validation of two measures that categorize the types of emails employees send/receive into two different constructs based on the perceived importance and importance and urgency. The measures were developed using Buss and Craik’s Act Frequency Approach. Analysis determined that our six-item important email and our eight-item important and urgent email scales were both reliable and valid measures of the constructs. Construct validity was demonstrated by embedding our measures in a nomological network linking email demands to employee well-being. The measures were found to be significant predictors of work-role overload, even when the more traditional measures used to quantify the demands imposed on employees by email were taken into account.

Lay Summary

This article presents two scales that can be used to measure the extent to which an employee perceives an email to be: (a) important and (b) both important and urgent. As expected by theory, both measures were found to predict employees’ feelings of being overloaded by their work. The interesting findings from this study are the following. First, employees seem to consider urgent emails to be important, perhaps without consideration to the email’s actual importance to the employee. Second, emails that are both important and urgent usually involve a key stakeholder being impacted if the email is not acted on quickly. Third, important emails are not necessarily considered urgent. To make an email urgent the sender has to explicitly state how the contents of the email will negatively impact key stakeholders. Finally, our findings suggest that reducing the volume of email someone has to process may not, on its own, lead to reduced employee stress. Rather, employers who seek to improve employee well-being should focus their efforts on reducing the volume of emails employees consider to be important and both important and urgent.",3.0,R,False,False,True,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,2.0,M,White,CA,Education,False,White only

We argue that the transition pattern of an individual’s social grooming style based on five social grooming behaviors at different times—referred to as the social grooming transition pattern—is the key to exploring this issue. Based on the social grooming style framework, we employed latent transition analysis through a nationally representative, three-year panel survey (N = 710) in Taiwan. We found that active users remained active in social grooming behavior and had options to shift, and inactive users largely remained inactive in terms of Facebook social grooming style. The results indicated that persistent social image managers gained the most social capital and well-being, greater than persistent social butterflies and those who transitioned from image managers to social butterflies, indicating that adopting strategic social grooming styles in the long-term delivered the best social outcomes.

Lay Summary

The long-term interaction between Facebook use and well-being has received limited attention with mixed results. One way to examine this is to study changes in the way that we “groom” one another in Facebook. That is, how we socially interact with others by discussing different topics with various styles and strategies. Based on the social grooming framework, we provide the first study employing latent transition analysis (i.e., to track how people change or maintain their social grooming style across time) to examine this issue using a nationally representative, three-year panel survey from Taiwan. Our study shows that most people maintain a stable user style over time. However, some become less active (e.g., they become “maintainers” or “lurkers”). Thus, the majority of Taiwanese users often do not create their own postings, but rather comment on, or simply view, the content of other Facebook users. By contrast, users who actively groom (e.g., those who are persistent “social butterflies” or “image managers”) continue to create online posts. Our analysis shows that users who are highly social benefit from greater bridging social capital. However, the strategically active social groomer is the winner as they benefit by gaining greater bridging social capital, social connectedness, and social life satisfaction.",3.0,R,False,False,True,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,2.0,F,Asian,TW,Education,False,Asian only

In a 2-day preregistered experiment conducted in a realistic social media simulation, participants encountered ambiguous or unambiguous harassment comments, which were ostensibly flagged by either other users, an automated system (AI), or an unidentified moderation source. The results reveal that visibility of a content moderation source inhibited participants’ flagging of a subsequent unmoderated harassment comment, presumably because their efforts were seen as dispensable, compared to when the moderation source was unknown. On the contrary, there was an indirect effect of other users versus AI as moderation source on subsequent flagging through changes in perceived social norms. Overall, this research shows that the effects of moderation transparency are complex, as increasing visibility of a content moderator may inadvertently inhibit bystander intervention.

This study examines the effects of flagging unmoderated offensive posts on social media, and how this changes the users’ subsequent behavior. We examined users’ reactions to the flagging of these posts by other users, an automated system, or an unspecified process to determine whether this affects the users’ ensuing behavior. A 2-day experiment on a simulated social media site showed that the visibility of the “flagger” impacts how users perceive social norms and think about the accountability for their own online actions.

Building on media multiplexity and attachment perspectives, we argue that communication over a dyad’s media ecosystem, including face-to-face, text messaging, cellphone calls, e-mail, and instant messaging, creates connected availability. Connected availability is the perception that a partner is at a continuous (digital) arm’s reach offering protection and security. Using longitudinal dyadic data of cohabitating romantic partners, we track the effects of media multiplexity on well-being by factoring in both partners’ perspectives to untangle the security offered through partner’s availability from the stress of maintaining one’s own constant availability to a partner. The results support salutary effects of media use on well-being because of increased connected availability, with limited evidence for adverse impacts of maintaining constant availability with a close partner.

The always-on, always-available nature of digital life means almost constant connection and availability between romantic partners, family members, and close friends. Being tethered to one another can give people a sense of security, while simultaneously causing more stress. In this article, we find that keeping a romantic partner constantly within a (digital) arm’s reach promotes better well-being for oneself. In addition, keeping a romantic partner always available also predicted better well-being for the romantic partner.

It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment, participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none, or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants, and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner’s reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However, when emotional support was absent, a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants’ stress.

In recent years, AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people’s worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences, they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual.

We found that users are continually pigeonholed into racial categories tethered to stereotypes, hierarchizing users such that the Chinese majority are considered more desirable. Users employ race labels to communicate racial membership, circumnavigating Grindr’s preset ethnic categories. Users also creatively appropriate interface affordances to enforce racialized preferences; this includes a preoccupation with verifying racial identities, especially through photos. Racial minorities strategically respond to sexual racism by negotiating for Chinese majority membership, emphasizing the cosmopolitan self over the ethnic self, and/or reframing the situation to disavow victimhood. This research counterbalances the ethnocentric focus of existing sexual racism literature on white-centric contexts by applying sexual fields theory to multiracial East Asia, yielding meaningful theoretical contributions. We also foreground the importance of considering internal dispositions of feelings and attitudes as situated resistance against sexual racism on Grindr.

This article explores how sexual desires of Singaporean users on Grindr (a gay dating app) are socially conditioned to include racial preferences, which in turn constitutes sexual racism. This research is important as it examines the complexities of sexual racism within a multiracial and postcolonial East Asian context, balancing the existing scholarly focus on sexual racism in Western societies. Our interviews with Grindr users in Singapore revealed that users tend to slot themselves (and others) into racial categories that appear fixed and linked to racial stereotypes. This allows a pecking order to emerge, such that the racial majority (Singaporean Chinese users) are generally seen as most desirable. Race is therefore one important dimension of the interactions on Grindr. If racial identity is not immediately obvious on app profiles, users often seek to find out the racial identities of other potential partners by, for example, requesting photos to make guesses about their race. We also studied the responses of racial minorities to sexual racism. These strategies include trying to present a Chinese or Chinese-mixed racial identity, emphasizing an identity that is globalized rather than ethnic, and reframing their situation to disavow their victimhood.",2.0,R,False,False,True,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,3.0,M,Asian,SG,Education,False,Asian only

These works suggest that users’ interactions can lead to cyberbalkanization when interlocutors form homophilous communities that typically have few connections to others with opposing ideologies. Yet, rather than assuming communities are isolated, this study examines community-level interactions to reveal how communities in online discourses are more interdependent than previously theorized. Specifically, we examine how such interactions influence the evolution of topics overtime in source and target communities. Our analysis found that (a) the size of a source community (the community that initiates interactions) and a target community (the community that receives interactions), (b) the stability of the source community, and (c) the volume of mentions from a source community to a target community predicts the level of influence one community has on another’s discussion topics. We argue this has significant theoretical and practical implications.

Political discussions online, especially those in the United States, seem to range between harmonious discussions of likeminded people and heated debates that end with few, if any, who have changed their minds. Researchers have often examined these balkanized/polarized situations by studying online communities as isolated echo chambers of opinion. Our study focuses on the interactions between online communities who have different worldviews. We examine communities engaged in the global refugee crisis. We consider how the inter-community interactions influence the agenda of the respective communities. Our longitudinal analysis on the one hand confirms previous studies, namely that intra-community interactions indeed resemble echo chambers. On the other hand, we also find that there is interdependence in the inter-community discussion topics, albeit some communities had greater influence on other communities’ discussion topics.

We report an online experiment of compliance-gaining conversations with 915 dyads of strangers recruited from Amazon M-Turk. The extent to which two strangers accommodated each other’s non-content linguistic features predicted their behavioral compliance—monetary donation to a charity. This accommodation–compliance link was (a) observed, to some extent, in both conversationalists in the dyads, albeit moderated by seeker–target role differentiation, (b) partially mediated by perceived warmth and competence, and (c) was robust against alternative mechanisms including compliance-gaining strategies, personalities, and demographics. We discuss implications regarding communication-induced influence in mediated conversations and related interpersonal communication processes in general.

How can a fleeting online interaction bring about compliance, especially for prosocial causes such as charity donation? This article finds that compliance is increased when there is a legacy of cooperative interactions (i.e., successful interaction rituals) on the part of all conversation partners—not just the one who seeks compliance. Such interaction can be identified when the individuals start to coordinate and accommodate each other’s language use (e.g., using similar expressions or adopting similar linguistic styles). The research shows that since online conversations often rely on text-based communication that lacks other channels with which to signal cooperative interactions, coordinated language plays an important role in gaining compliance.",2.0,R,False,False,True,True,2,1,True,False,False,False,4.0,M,Asian,US,Education,True,cross race

Although coming from a homophobic generation, our senior participant had no issue becoming an online celebrity on the app because his wife had passed away, pointing out the intersectional influence of generational and relational backgrounds. Our participants’ socio-economic positions also shaped whom they would interact with on Blued and how these interactions took place.

We manipulated burden by having participants recall (Study 2) or, in Studies 1 and 3, read and think about a Facebook friend who was burdensome, neutral, or rewarding. When recalling or thinking about a burdensome, compared to rewarding or neutral, Facebook friend, participants self-reported more pain, increased negative affect, and indicated they would do more exclusionary Facebook behaviors. Moreover, physical and affective components of self-reported pain mediated the relation between burden and exclusionary behavior.

In social media, this relationship is rooted in a sender's expectations for audience response and the imagined responsive audience. Using experience sampling, we show that anticipated interaction varies across social media. Further, we outline the relational and situational factors associated with expecting response and the specificity of imagined responsive audience.

Unfortunately, many people, especially those in low socioeconomic groups, those without health insurance, and minority groups have very low cancer screening rates. As a result of not being screened, these populations face higher rates of cancer. One way to improve cancer screening rates in low income and minority populations is to target the healthcare staff which works with them. CancerSPACE (Simulated Practice and Collaborative Education) is aimed to improve cancer screening education among healthcare professionals in a virtual, interactive, easy to use online simulation presented in a game format.

This information was adjusted in order to remove the effects of generally increased use over time. The analysis shows that the proportion of text messages sent by different age groups stays rather stable over time. Indeed there seems to be a type of “standing wave” of use associated with older teens and those in their early 20s. While there are cohort effects visible in the data, the analysis indicates that texting is largely a life phase phenomenon. If the curve had flattened out with time it would have indicated that the teens are carrying texting with them as they grow older. This, it seems is not the case.

Drawing in part on Rebecca Wanzo’s consideration of “precarious-girl comedy” (2016) I examine how two British television comedies intensified these intimate connections through the use of direct address, binding the audience tightly to the sexual and social misadventures of their twenty-something female protagonists. Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum (E4, 2015–2017) follows naïve and desperately horny black working-class Londoner Tracey in her quest for sexual experience, and Phoebe-Waller Bridges’ Fleabag (BBC Three, 2016–) documents an unnamed upper-middle-class white woman’s sharply misanthropic journey through grief. In both programmes direct address serves to intensify the embrace of bodily affect and intimate access to interiority found in the “precarious-girl comedy” (Wanzo, 2016), producing moments of comic and emotional repulsion. Each program uses direct address’s blend of directness and distance to different ends, but both draw audiences at times uncomfortably close to the singular perspective of their protagonists, creating an intensely affective comic intimacy.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,White,GB,Education,False,White only

La (ré)invention de Home Affairs : Solidarité féministe et la nation sud-africaine

La série télévisée sud-africaine Home Affairs met en relief le défi que constitue la création d'une idée de nation unie et homogène. Les images hétérogènes de neuf personnages féminins, campées dans le discours de construction de la nation, attirent l'attention sur les questions d'égalité et d'autonomie. Toutefois, ces représentations exposent aussi des ruptures au sein même du féminisme. On reproche au projet nationaliste entendu comme sensibilité féministe de trahir la nation. Situant ces tensions dans leur contexte féministe et historique, je soutiens que Home Affairs représente une allégorie de la renaissance ou de la reconstruction de la nation. Cependant, bien que Home Affairs puisse être vue comme représentante de la nation qui valorise les valeurs de la classe moyenne, la série démontre aussi les intérêts rivaux des forces de solidarité nationale et du libre-marché, qui perpétuent la ségrégation socioéconomique et éducative.

Erfindung und Wiederentdeckung von Home Affairs: Feministische Solidarität und die südafrikanische Nation

Shelley-Jean Bradfield

Die südafrikanische Fernsehsendung Home Affairs (Heimatangelegenheiten) betont die Herausforderung, eine geeinte und homogene Vorstellung von Nation zu schaffen. Die heterogene Darstellung von neun Protagonistinnen, die in diesem Diskurs der Nationenbildung angelegt ist, lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit auf Themen wie Gleichheit und Empowerment, welche innerhalb der feministischen Praxis und Theorie elementar sind. Allerdings zeigen diese unterschiedlichen Repräsentationen auch Bruchstellen innerhalb und zwischen Feminismus und dem Projekt des Nationalismus auf, da eine feministische Sensibilität oft als Verrat der Nation kritisiert wird. Indem ich die Spannungen innerhalb der feministischen Diskussion und dem historischen Kontext von Südafrika herausarbeite, argumentiere ich, dass Home Affairs als Allegorie fungiert, um die Wiedergeburt oder Wiederherstellung einer Nation zu repräsentieren. Auch wenn das Projekt Home Affairs als Repräsentant einer Nation, die die Werte der Mittelschicht aufwertet, gelesen werden kann, zeigt es gleichzeitig die konkurrierenden Interessen von nationaler Solidarität und den Kräften des freien Marktes, welche ökonomische, bildungsbezogene und soziale Segregation aufrechterhalten.



(Re-)Inventando Los Asuntos de la Casa : La Solidaridad Feminista y la Nación de Sudáfrica

Shelley-Jean Bradfield Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47401, USA

Resumen

El programa de televisión “Los Asuntos de la Casa” producido en Sudáfrica, pone en primer plano el desafío de crear una noción unitaria y homogénea de la nación. La heterogeneidad de las imágenes de 9 protagonistas femeninos colocados dentro del discurso para armar la nación, llama la atención sobre los asuntos de igualdad y el fortalecimiento del poder. No obstante, estas representaciones exponen también las rupturas entre el feminismo, y el proyecto de nacionalismo como una sensibilidad feminista a menudo criticada como una traición a la nación. Localizando estas tensiones dentro de los contextos feministas e históricos, sostengo que “Los Asuntos de la Casa” representan alegóricamente el renacimiento o reconstrucción de la nación. No obstante, aunque “Los Asuntos de la Casa” pueden ser leídos como una representación que valoriza los valores de la clase media, simultáneamente demuestran los intereses competitivos de la solidaridad nacional y las fuerzas del mercado libre que perpetúan la segregación socioeconómica y educacional.",11.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,White,US,Education,True,White only

This paper examines how issues of power, labor, and leisure were articulated among various contest participants through interviews, analysis, and observation. Emergent from the data are themes of creativity, authenticity, and empowerment that converge and diverge. It is precisely because of the polysemic nature of these themes that the contest was able to simultaneously endorse the product, exploit participant labor, and give consumers a sense of power as individuals, as women, and as creative professionals.

L'autonomie par la caution? Le sens polysémique des publicités de Dove créées par les utilisatrices

Brooke Erin Duffy

Bien que les campagnes de marketing générées par l'utilisateur aient été citées comme preuves du «nouveau consommateur autonome», d'autres ont souligné leur nature exploitante. Ce débat se complique lorsqu'il est mis en dialogue avec une rhétorique féministe d'autonomisation, comme celle soutenant un récent concours de publicités créées par les consommatrices pour l'entreprise Dove. À travers des entretiens, des analyses et des observations, cet article étudie la façon dont les enjeux de pouvoir, de travail et de loisir s'articulaient pour divers participants au concours. La créativité, l'authenticité et l'autonomisation émergent des données comme étant des thèmes convergeants et divergeants. C'est précisément en raison de la nature polysémique de ces thèmes que le concours fut en mesure de tout à la fois appuyer le produit, exploiter le travail des participants et donner aux consommatrices un sentiment de pouvoir en tant que personnes, en tant que femmes et en tant que professionnelles créatrices.

Empowerment durch Bestätigung? Polysemische Bedeutung in der nutzergenerierten Werbung von Dove

Brooke Erin Duffy

Im Kontext des digitalen Zeitalters der Massenkommunikation, löst sich die einstige Trennung zwischen Medienproduktion und Konsum anscheinend auf, und an dieser Stelle entsteht eine Kultur der Interaktivität. Konsumenten nehmen nicht nur mehr an der Produktion von Nachrichten und Unterhaltung teil, sie werden auch aktiv in kommerzielle Initiativen einbezogen. Auch wenn einige nutzergenerierte Marketing-Kampagnen als Beweis für den „empowerten Konsumenten“ anführen, betonen andere den ausbeuterischen Charakter dieses Produktionsprozesses. Diese Ausbeutungs-Empowerment-Debatte wird zudem durch die Verknüpfung mit der feministischen Rhetorik von Empowerment verkompliziert, welche durch den aktuellen nutzergenerierten Werbewettbewerb von Dove verdeutlicht wird. In diesem Artikel untersuche ich mittels Interviews, Diskursanalyse und teilnehmender Online-Beobachtung, wie Aspekte von Macht, Arbeit und Freizeit von verschiedenen Wettbewerbsteilnehmern artikuliert wurden – Dove-Geschäftsführer, Amateur-Werbeproduzenten und Online-Publikum. Aus den Daten ergeben sich Themen wie Kreativität, Authentizität und Empowerment, welche auf verschiedene Art und Weise zusammenhängen und divergieren. Genauer gesagt, lag es an der polysemischen Natur dieser Themen, dass es mit diesem Wettbewerb möglich war, zugleich das Produkt zu stützen, die Arbeit der Teilnehmer auszunutzen und den Konsumenten ein Gefühl von Macht als Individuen, Frauen und kreative Professionelle zu geben.

Resumen

Aunque algunos han citado las campañas de mercadotecnia generadas por el usuario como evidencia del “nuevo fortalecimiento del poder del consumidor,” otros han enfatizado su naturaleza explotadora. Este debate se hace más complicado cuando es traído dentro del diálogo de una retórica feminista de fortalecimiento del poder, tal que apuntala una competencia reciente de un aviso publicitario de Dove generado por el usuario. Este artículo examina cómo estos asuntos de poder, trabajo, y placer, fueron articulados entre varios participantes de la competencia a través de entrevistas, análisis, y observación. Emergiendo de los datos son temas de creatividad, autenticidad, y fortalecimiento del poder que converge y diverge. Es precisamente a raíz de la naturaleza polisémica de estos temas que la competencia fue capaz de avalar simultáneamente el producto, explotar el trabajo del participante, y dar a los consumidores un sentido de poder como individuos, como mujeres, y como profesionales creativos.",14.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,White,US,Education,True,White only

One limit is practical: Media advocacy's reliance on journalists working in commercial media radically constrains advocates' ability to reach policy makers and citizens in anything more than an episodic way. Another limit is conceptual. By implicitly endorsing an elitist theory of democracy and focusing on mainstream journalism, media advocacy fails to theorize the crucial role media resources and strategies play within local social change movements. The article concludes by exploring what the theory and practice of media advocacy might look like if informed by an alternative, more participatory theory of democracy as well as a commitment to promoting media reform.

Les limites de l'action au sein des médias

Timothy A. Gibson

Cet article soutient que la théorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des médias souffre de limites pragmatiques et conceptuelles inhérentes. L'une des limites est d'ordre pratique : la dépendance des acteurs vis-à-vis des journalistes œuvrant dans les médias commerciaux restreint de façon radicale la capacité des militant d'atteindre les responsables et les citoyens à un rythme autre qu'épisodique. Une autre limite est d'ordre conceptuel. En soutenant implicitement une vision élitiste de la démocratie et en se concentrant sur le journalisme dominant, l'action au sein des médias omet de théoriser le rôle crucial que jouent les ressources et les stratégies médiatiques dans les mouvements locaux pour le changement social. L'article conclut avec une exploration de ce dont pourrait avoir l'air la théorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des médias si elles étaient informées par une théorie de la démocratie alternative, plus participative, et par un engagement envers la promotion d'une réforme médiatique.

Die Grenzen des Medienlobbyismus

Timothy A. Gibson

Medienlobbyismus wurde als ein Ansatz der Gesundheitskommunikationskampagnen von Public Health Wissenschaftler Lawrence Wallack entwickelt und sollte für den kritischen Medienwissenschaftler von großem Interesse sein. Medienlobbyismus bedient sich Agenda- Setting und Framing-Theorie, um Aktivisten für die Bevölkerungsgesundheit dabei zu unterstützen, Nachrichtenberichterstattung in kommerziellen Lokalmedien herzustellen und zu gestalten. Diese Berichterstattung wird dann wiederum genutzt, Druck auf Politiker auszuüben, wichtige soziale und gesundheitsbezogene Probleme zu beseitigen. Es gibt viel, was man bezüglich dieses politikzentrierten Ansatzes von Gesundheitskampagnen bewundern kann, insbesondere wenn man den individualisierten und freiwilligen Charakter der meisten anderen Ansätze der Gesundheitskommunikation dagegensetzt. Dennoch argumentiert dieser Artikel, dass die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus an einigen ihr inhärenten pragmatischen und konzeptuellen Grenzen leidet. Eine Grenze ist praktischer Natur: Die Abhängigkeit der Medienlobbyisten von Journalisten der kommerziellen Medien beschneidet ihre Möglichkeiten, Politiker und Bürger anders als auf episodische Art und Weise zu erreichen. Eine andere Grenze ist konzeptuell: Indem implizit einer Elitetheorie von Demokratie angenommen wird und indem auf Mainstream-Journalisten und Medien fokussiert wird, versäumt es der Medienlobbyismus theoretisch zu bedenken, welche zentrale Rolle Medienressourcen und Strategien in lokalen Bewegungen gesellschaftlichen Wandels spielen. Diese Artikel schließt mit der Untersuchung, wie die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus wohl aussehen würde, würde sie aus einer alternativen, mehr auf Teilhabe ausgerichteten Demokratietheorie und einem Engagement für die Förderung einer Medienreform gespeist werden.



Los Límites del Apoyo de los Medios

Resumen

Este artículo sostiene que la teoría y práctica del apoyo de los medios sufre de algunos límites pragmáticos y conceptuales inherentes. Un límite práctico es: la dependencia en el apoyo de los medios de los periodistas trabajando en medios comerciales que constriñen radicalmente la habilidad de los defensores para alcanzar a los creadores de políticas y los ciudadanos en nada más que una forma episódica. Otro límite es conceptual. Al avalar implícitamente una teoría elitista de la democracia y focalizar en el periodismo de la corriente dominante, el apoyo de los medios falla en teorizar el rol crucial de los recursos de los medios y las estrategias que juegan dentro de los movimientos sociales de cambio local. Este artículo concluye con una exploración de cómo la teoría y la práctica del apoyo de los medios sería si estuvieran informadas por una teoría de la democracia alternativa, más participativa así como también un compromiso hacia la reforma de los medios.",13.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,M,White,US,Education,True,White only

Nationalism seemed to play a noticeable role in newsmaking, a role whose importance probably extends beyond this intifada per se and even the Palestinian-Israeli conflict at large.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,Middle Eastern,EG,Education,False,Middle Eastern only

Using discourse analysis, it asks whether coverage reflects traditional Islamic or Islamic feminist perspectives. The findings indicate the news overwhelmingly reflected traditional Islamic beliefs concerning the secondary status of Muslim women. Coverage minimized the violence, blamed victims, omitted women's voices, and treated sympathetically men who committed honor crimes. However, an Islamic feminist perspective was evident in some content that challenged women's segregation in Saudi Arabia. This study concludes that this news coverage shares many of the same characteristics of news reporting of violence against women in the West by ignoring its systemic nature and relation to male supremacy and patriarchal ideology.",1.0,R,False,False,False,True,2,1,False,False,False,False,2.0,F,Middle Eastern,US,Education,True,cross race

I argue that the obese body serves as a field on which broader tensions relevant to consumption, which prominently characterize this historical moment in the U.S., are reflected, negotiated, and rationalized. Specifically, the obese body has both prompted discourse regarding consuming patterns and practices and mobilized the discourse of neoliberalism by engaging key cultural imperatives of citizenship—namely, privacy, individualism, and freedom. This rhetorical crafting of and by the obese body has significant cultural implications, as well as theoretical implications for the relationship between body and discourse.",1.0,R,False,False,False,False,1,1,False,False,False,False,1.0,F,White,US,Education,True,White only
