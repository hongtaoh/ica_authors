## Paper classification ICR

First, with `2022-08-20-new-cat-issueurl.ipynb`, we get the list of all categories with associated frequencies. Then in this the dataset, we (Kristen, Jeff and I) reclassified categories: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E2dgJCpv5FrxKv41QZuNsv7MjJs3IcBxFbZze_5rnjU/edit#gid=2060805888

After we classified these categories as either "to exclude" or not, I put the raw result into `data/interim/cat_class_raw.csv`

- `data/interim/icr/paper_classification_icr_test_2022-08-27.csv` is the randomly selected 100 rows to test paper classification intercoder reliability. This dataset is generated by `2022-08-27-GET-100-random-papers-to-classify-types-for-ICR.ipynb`. 

- This is the raw result: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POuzorD6B2r8uO9gdpBgt1U1ZksJhbCTzaolnAKQpmU/edit#gid=1585704198

Krippendorff alpha: 0.831

- `paper_cla_ica_compa_results_2022-08-29.csv` is the aggregated results. This result is computed by `2022-08-29-calculate-paper-cla-icr.ipynb`

- Then, We did all the classification here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uslTqfe269jf0KHJ8E70XHru2jag8y-iiRRb94HQA9s/edit#gid=349722970, which is created by `2022-08-29-randomly-split-ica-paper-df-for-paper-classification.ipynb`

- We tested final icr here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KvPvm5DWAP9ndPbB4yfEWyet5WIu0rfKsqM_FL2kbP8/edit?usp=sharing
  - This is created by `2022-09-12-GET-100-random-papers-to-classify-types-for-final-ICR.ipynb`
  - Result: `2022-09-13-calculate-paper-classification-final-icr.ipynb`. 
  - Final ICR: .79
